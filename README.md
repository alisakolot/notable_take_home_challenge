# Notable Take Home Challenge 

To run: 
1. Run requirements.txt 
2. Use  `python crud_operations.py` to run


Due to an error in my virtual environment I was unable to creat a database in the time given to complete this challenge, therefore I choose to create a JSON file that had basic information from the database. 

If I had additional time I would have created a database with the example data that was given and would write tests. I tested my current file with small sample data sets included in the file.
